# 🌙 Gensokyo: Reverie of Lost Dreams

**Gensokyo: Reverie of Lost Dreams** is a **server-side** mod based on the *Touhou Project* universe.  
It is currently under active development and aims to deliver a rich danmaku-style fantasy experience, combining mystical dimensions, food systems, and original recipes.

> ⚠️ This mod does not require installation on the client to connect — similar to *ItemsAdder* behavior.

## 🔖 Important Notes

- ✅ **Client installation is not required**
- 🔄 **Compatible with item managers** such as **Polydex** and **EIV** (But you need install [polydex2eiv](https://github.com/SAGUMEDREAM/Polydex2EIV/releases), 1.21.6+ needs using [Ported EIV](https://github.com/SAGUMEDREAM/ExtendedItemView))
- ❌ **NeoForge**, **Quilt**, and **Bukkit+Fabric mixes** will never be supported
- 🌏 Imperfect **English translation**

---

## 🌏 Translation issues
Simplified Chinese will be updated first, followed by Traditional Chinese, and finally English
